# 301-lab-07-back-end
Code Fellows lab 07 workspace with Brett Packard

**Author**: Daniel Nguyen & Brett Packard
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We are hoping to build a backend for a frontend app that shows all kinds of information based on city input from the user. The backend should deliver weather, restaurant, and event data.

## Getting Started
The user will simply need to clone down our repo in order to use this app. They will also need access to the front end provided by our class demo.

## Architecture
This application will be primarily built with JavaScript and JSON. It will be interacting with HTML and CSS provided by a separate developer. The API information will be accessed and massaged by Node, npm, Super Agent, express, cors, and dotenv.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
